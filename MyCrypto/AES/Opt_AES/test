responsible for managing the new national park, tapping military personnel to help with its operation. but by the 1890s, the military no longer had a need for a base there and threatened to abandon their stewardship, causing michigan’s governor to petition congress to turn the park over to the state. in the roughly 125 years since, the island has remained mackinac island state park, a slice of paradise in the great lakes region where motor vehicles are banned and visitors travel the rolling two-lane roads via bicycle or horse and buggy. the island has become a popular destination for hikers

running to become a national park in the first place.once the dust from the war settled, mackinac island remained home to fort mackinac, a military garrison. seeing an opportunity, in 1875, congress
