improve your english through reading
josef essberger

right now you are reading english. that means that you are using your brain in a very active way. reading is a very active process. it is true that the writer does a lot of work, but the reader also has to work hard. when you read a text, you have to do some or all of these:

imagine a scene in your head
understand clearly what the writer is trying to say
agree or disagree with the writer
advantages of reading
when you learn a language, listening, speaking and writing are important, but reading can also be very helpful. there are many advantages associated with reading, including:

learning vocabulary in context
you will usually encounter new words when you read. if there are too many new words for you, then the level is too high and you should read something simpler. but if there are, say, a maximum of five new words per page, you will learn this vocabulary easily. you may not even need to use a dictionary because you can guess the meaning from the rest of the text (from the context). not only do you learn new words, but you see them being used naturally.

a model for writing
when you read, it gives you a good example for writing. texts that you read show you structures and expressions that you can use when you write.

seeing "correctly structured" english
when people write, they usually use "correct" english with a proper grammatical structure. this is not always true when people speak. so, by reading you see and learn grammatical english naturally.

working at your own speed
you can read as fast or as slowly as you like. you can read ten pages in 30 minutes, or take one hour to explore just one page. it doesn't matter. the choice is yours. you cannot easily do this when speaking or listening. this is one of the big advantages of reading because different people work at different speeds.

personal interest
if you choose something to read that you like, it can actually be interesting and enjoyable. for example, if you like to read about football in your own language, why not read about football in english? you will get information about football and improve your english at the same time.

five tips for reading
tip #1
try to read at the right level. read something that you can (more or less) understand. if you need to stop every three words to look in a dictionary, it is not interesting for you and you will soon be discouraged.

tip #2
make a note of new vocabulary. if there are four or five new words on a page, write them in your vocabulary book. but you don't have to write them while you read. instead, try to guess their meaning as you read; mark them with a pen; then come back when you have finished reading to check in a dictionary and add them to your vocabulary book.

tip #3
try to read regularly. for example, read for a short time once a day. fifteen minutes every day is better than two hours every sunday. fix a time to read and keep to it. for example, you could read for fifteen minutes when you go to bed, or when you get up, or at lunchtime.

tip #4
be organised. have everything ready:

something to read
a marker to highlight difficult words
a dictionary
your vocabulary book
a pen to write down the new words
tip #5

read what interests you. choose a magazine or book about a subject that you like.
